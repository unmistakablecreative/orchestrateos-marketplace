1. **Receive the student work** - Read the submitted material (essay, code, assignment, project)

2. **Analyze the work**:
   - Identify strengths and what was done well
   - Find areas needing improvement
   - Note specific examples from the work
   - Consider the context (grade level, assignment requirements if provided)

3. **Structure the feedback**:

   ```

4. **Tone guidelines**:
   - Be encouraging but honest
   - Focus on the work, not the person
   - Make criticism constructive with clear paths to improvement
   - Use specific examples rather than vague statements
   - Balance praise and critique appropriately

5. **Output the feedback** in markdown format

## Examples

- If rubric or criteria provided, use it to structure feedback
