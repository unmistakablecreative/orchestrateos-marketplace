1. **Read the source content**
   - Accept blog post, article, or long-form text
   - Extract key themes, insights, quotes, and data points
   - Identify the core message and supporting arguments

2. **Generate 5 Tweet Threads**
   - Each thread: 3-7 tweets
   - Hook tweet must grab attention (question, bold statement, or surprising fact)
   - Use thread structure: hook → context → insights → takeaway
   - Include relevant hashtags (2-3 per thread)
   - Vary angles: listicle, story, contrarian take, how-to, behind-the-scenes

3. **Generate 1 LinkedIn Post**
   - 1,200-1,500 characters optimal
   - Professional tone, insight-focused
   - Structure: hook line → white space → body → CTA
   - Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at end
   - Add line breaks for readability

4. **Generate 1 Newsletter Section**
   - 200-400 words
   - Conversational, personal tone
   - Include one key takeaway
   - End with a question or call-to-action
   - Can reference the full blog post

5. **Output Format**
   ```
   ## Tweet Thread 1: [Angle]
   🧵 1/X [Hook tweet]
   2/X [Content]
   ...

   ## Tweet Thread 2: [Angle]
   ...
